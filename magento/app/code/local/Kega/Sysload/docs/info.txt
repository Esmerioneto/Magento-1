== Sysload module ==
Redirect visitors to static service page on high server load.

There are several options for redirecting:
- Redirect only new visitors.
- Redirect all visitors except the ones in the checkout
- Redirect all visitors.

The load treshold for all these options is configurable per option. 

=== Testing ===
For testing purposes load value can be faked. Use "?test-load=22" in url to 
simulate a load of 22. 

=== Configuration ===
Config settings can be found under: 
System > Configuration > System > Sysload
