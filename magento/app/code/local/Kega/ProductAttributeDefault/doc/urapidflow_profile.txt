## File creation
##----------------------------------------------
NOTE:
Product Enricher generates a file for every profile and selected stores within profile
because we have different columns to update for each profile and in urapidflow you cannot add
the store in the import file, only in the profile configuration.
When there are categories to be removed from products, a seperate file is created, because
these files need to be run with the Products Extra import, not the Products import. These
files have the prefix profile_extra instead of profile.

Example:
	profile 1:
	id: 1
	selected Stores id: 4, 5
	Generated files: profile-1_store-4.txt, profile-1_store-5.txt

	profile 5:
	id: 5
	selected Stores id: 1
	Generated files: profile-5_store-1.txt, profile_extra-5_store-1.txt

The urapidflow storeid and filename is dynamicaly changed for each product enricher file
that has to be imported.
The product enricher profile with the lowest id is runned first. In the example above the
order is:
	profile-1_store-4.txt, profile-1_store-5.txt, profile-5_store-1.txt, profile_extra-5_store-1.txt

The generated files are saved in var/urapidflow/product_enricher/
where var is magento var dir.
After each file is imported with urapidflow, the file is moved to backup folder:
var/urapidflow/product_enricher/backup.
